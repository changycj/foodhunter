node-krb5
=========
### Node.js native addon for simple krb5 user authentication

The module currently builds on linux with krb5 headers and libs (tested on centos), osx (tested on lion and mountain lion) and windows (tested on windows 8.1 with MIT Kerberos)

Installation
------------

You can install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-krb5
```

On windows you will need to have MIT Kerberos (http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/dist/) installed. Remember to select the SDK option during installation.

You will also need to set the environment variable MITKRB5 to the MIT Kerberos home. 

```
set MITKRB5=C:\Program Files\MIT\Kerberos
```

How to Use
----------

``` js
var krb5 = require('node-krb5');

krb5.authenticate('username@REALM', 'password', function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log("Error: " + err);
  } else {
    console.log("OK");
  }
});
```
