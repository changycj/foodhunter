FoodHunter Design Doc
Rebekah Cha

Purpose:
	-Allows MIT affiliates to notify everyone about food events
	-Lets MIT affiliates view where free food is on campus
	-Filters the notifications that MIT affiliates receive about free food

	
Collections would include: 
	- eventcollection. It would contain String fields such as food type, event name, date, time and location. 
	- commentcollection. It would have a reference field to the event. And have a String field for the body of the comment.

Views:
	- New Event:
		-To input information indicating that there is free food, a user would use an online form which would include: event, food, date, time and location. 
	- Event listings:
		-Shows a list of all the events. Has options that lists by day or week.
		-Other users are allowed to comment indicating that there is no more food.
	-Map:
		-Shows a visualization of all the events by location. This is a layout of the MIT campus. And colored in would be where a free food event is occuring. 

GET methods:
	- GET newevent:
		-Renders the New Event page
	- GET eventlist:
		-Gets eventcollection, and querying it using the current date and future dates. Then finds the corresponding comments in commentcolection.
		-Renders the list of events with the list of events and collections
	- GET map:
		-Gets eventcollection, and queries it using the current date and future dates. Then sorts it by location.
		-Renders the map with the list of events.

POST methods:
	- POST newevent:
		-Takes the information from the New Event page and makes a new entry in eventcollection.
	- POST comment:
		-Takes information from the Event listings page (where users can input comments) and makes a new entry in the commentcollection.
	- POST deletecomment:
		-Removes a comment from the commentcollection.

Potential challenges:
	- Dynamic update for expiring food events

Other:
	-Unsure about storing users in database. Want to use MIT certificate to ensure that the user is part of the MIT community, however.
